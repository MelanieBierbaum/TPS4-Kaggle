# TPS4-Kaggle
This is my Jupyter Notebook for the Kaggle Competition: Tabular Playground Series April 2021

<b>About the competition:</b>

The dataset is used for this competition is synthetic but based on a real dataset (in this case, the actual Titanic data!) and generated using a CTGAN. The statistical properties of this dataset are very similar to the original Titanic dataset, but there's no way to "cheat" by using public labels for predictions.

<b>My notebook contains the following steps:</b>
-	“manual” baseline in order to check which score the model must beat
-	Exploratory Data Analysis
-	Feature Engineering
-	Data Preprocessing
-	Modelling
    - Logistic Regression
    - Decision Tree
    - Random Forest
    - XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning
-	Analysis of wrong predictions
